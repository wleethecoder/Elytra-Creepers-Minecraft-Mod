# Elytra Creepers

The Elytra Creepers mod features AI-controlled creepers capable of advanced aerial navigation using elytras. The creepers should be able to fly to a grounded target--while maximizing flight time efficiency and minimizing fall damage.

The creepers are trained using Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT), a well-known neuroevolution method. Neuroevolution is a “survival of the fittest” deep learning technique that combines evolutionary biology with neural networks: a population of agents run a task, a fitness score is used to evaluate performance, those deemed the fittest produce the next generation of agents, and so on.

This is a work in progress, and I am currently running the training for the neural networks.
